# Smart Pool Control System - Group 13

This project is an Internet of Things (IoT) based Smart Pool Control System developed as a university group project. It enables real-time monitoring and automation of various pool-related functions using Raspberry Pi 4, MQTT, sensors, actuators and Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi 5.

---

## Project Purpose

The system is designed to:

- Monitor **water temperature**, **pH level**, **water level**, **light intensity**, **motion** and **time**
- Control actuators such as **LEDs**, **servo motors**, **camera** and **display**
- Visualize data via **Home Assistant**
- Use **MQTT** as a communication protocol to connect distributed components

---

## How the System Works

The Raspberry Pi 4 serves as the central hub. Each sensor or actuator is connected to a Python script (located in the `final_scripts` folder) that either publishes data or listens for control messages via MQTT.

### Workflow:

1. **Sensors** (e.g., temperature, pH, light) publish readings via MQTT.
2. **Subscribers/Actuators** (e.g., display, motors) listen and act based on MQTT messages.
3. **Home Assistant** displays sensor values.

## Folder: `final_scripts`

This folder contains all final working scripts divided into publishers and subscribers:

| Script                         | Topic | Description | 
|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| `B_Servo_Subscriber.py`        | waterlevel, pumpStatus  | Controls a servo motor based on the current waterlevel |
| `B_Waterlevel_Publisher.py`    | waterlevel | Publishes water level data from an ultrasonic sensor |
| `E_TimeSignal_Subscriber.py`   | timeSignal | Displays pump status based on received time-triggered messages |
| `E_TimeSignal_Publisher.py`    | timeSignal | Publishes scheduled on/off signals for simulated pump control |
| `H_Camera_Subscriber.py`       | distance, images | Captures images based on the current distance detection and generates a video stream |
| `H_Distance_Publisher.py`      | distance | Publishes data from distance sensor |
| `L_Display_Subscriber.py`      | temperature | Displays temperature data on an e-paper display |
| `L_Temperature_Publisher.py`   | temperature, humidity | Publishes the temperature and humidity |
| `R_Light_Subscriber.py`        | light | Controls lighting based on received light values |
| `R_Light_Publisher.py`         | light | Publishes ambient light level |
| `S_LedServo_Subscriber.py`     | ph, phPumpStatus | Controls LED and servo motor (e.g. for pH regulation) |
| `S_PH_Publisher.py`            | ph | Publishes data from the pH sensor |

Each script connects to a local MQTT broker and communicates via structured topics such as `sensor/temperature` or `sensor/distance`.

## Getting Started

### 1. Set up

#### 1.1. Raspberry Pi 4, Sensors & Actors

Wire the Raspberry Pi 4 and the needed components (actors, sensors, etc. )

Connect your device and the Raspberry Pi 4 via WLAN, ensure to use the correct IP address

```
ssh admin@192.168.8.113
```

Enable the needed Interfaces I2C and SPI in the Raspberry Configurations: 

```
sudo raspi-config
```
Interfacing Options > I2C > Enable

Interfacing Options > SPI > Enable

```
sudo reboot
```

Create and activate the virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source ~venv/bin/activate
```

Download needed packages in the venv environment
```
pip install ...
```
``` 
git clone https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper.git
```

#### 1.2. Raspberry Pi 5 & Homeassistant

Set Up the Homeassistant environment on the Raspberry Pi 5

Set up MQTT integration in Home Assistant and add sensors using MQTT topics published by the scripts.


Install the MQTT broker on the homeassistant.

Establish connection

Configure displays

TODO Hanna

### 2. Run Sensor/Actuator Scripts

Run each script on Raspberry Pi by executing the following command in seperate terminals on the device. Ensure that the connection is established and the venv environment is activated.

```
python3 B_Servo_Subscriber.py
```
